# Improving graphics performance in Kaboom3000

> tga, 01/15/2023

## Use in-place matrix math

> performance gain: 1.2x

Due to the batched renderer kaboom is using, all vertex transformation are done on the CPU. Kaboom was using this style of matrix math:

```js
class Mat4 {
    static translate(x, y) {
        return new Mat4([
            1, 0, 0, 0,
            0, 1, 0, 0,
            0, 0, 1, 0,
            x, y, 0, 1,
        ])
    }
    translate(x, y) {
        return this.mult(Mat4.translate(x, y))
    }
}
```

This is inefficient because:
- it's allocating a new `Mat4` on every transform
- it's doing a full matrix multiplication on every transform

while in fact we only need to in-place change few fields while doing these types of transforms, which gets rid of the extra allocation and unused calculations.

```js
class Mat4 {
	translate(x, y) {
		this.m[12] += this.m[0] * x + this.m[4] * y
		this.m[13] += this.m[1] * x + this.m[5] * y
		this.m[14] += this.m[2] * x + this.m[6] * y
		this.m[15] += this.m[3] * x + this.m[7] * y
		return this
	}
}
```

## Getting rid of spread operators

> performance gain: 2x

Kaboom uses a lot of spread operators to forward drawing options to other draw functions, for example

```js
function drawSprite(opts) {
    // doing some calculations above, then forward
    drawTexture({
        ...opts,
        tex: spr.data.tex,
        quad: q.scale(opt.quad || new Quad(0, 0, 1, 1)),
    }))
}
```

However we found spread operators are extremely slow if called thousands times per frame, changing every spread operator to `Object.assign()` ups the performance by 2x. Easiest performance gain ever.

```js
function drawSprite(opts) {
    drawTexture(Object.assign(opt, {
        tex: spr.data.tex,
        quad: q.scale(opt.quad ?? new Quad(0, 0, 1, 1)),
    }))
}
```

## Automatically batch textures

> performance gain: up to 50x

It's expensive to initiate a draw call (`gl.drawElements()`, `gl.drawArrays()` etc.) in WebGL. Kaboom uses a batched renderer that keeps all shape vertices data in a buffer and only initiates a draw call at frame end or when texture changes. This approach makes it fast to draw a lot of 2d shapes with the same texture, however when texture changes a lot it can be slower than the naive render approach.

Consider this example:

```js
kaboom()

loadSprite("bean", "sprites/bean.png")

for (let i = 0; i < 5000; i++) {
	add([
		sprite("bean"),
		pos(rand(0, width()), rand(0, height())),
		anchor("center"),
	])
}
```

It renders 5000 sprites. After

However, if you draw the same amount of sprites but alternate between 2 sprites, this example will crash your browser tab:

```js
kaboom()

loadSprite("bean", "sprites/bean.png")
loadSprite("bag", "sprites/bag.png")

for (let i = 0; i < 5000; i++) {
	add([
		sprite(i % 2 === 0 ? "bean" : "bag"),
		pos(rand(0, width()), rand(0, height())),
		anchor("center"),
	])
}
```

In v3000 Kaboom introduced a machanism to automatically batch all sprites to a large texture atlas when loaded. As a result, the later example have the exact same performance with the former one.
