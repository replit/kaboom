# Kaboom v3000.2

> tga, 12/31/2023

## Stream Audio

Audio files are often the biggest file you load in Kaboom if you have long background music. Previously you can only use `loadSound()` which would loads the entire file before the game starts and blocks the loading screen.

The new `loadMusic()` will load an audio file without blocking loading

```js
loadMusic("background", "/assets/music/background.mp3")
// note that browser requires user input before audio can be played!
play("background")
```

## Canvas

Kaboom adds the ability to use offscreen canvas!

```js
const canvas = canvas()
```
