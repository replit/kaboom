# Burp Jam
> danie & tga, 10/10/2022

Kaboom new jam! Burp Jam, a jam where the goal is to upload the best burp sound ever, and we will implement it in `burp()`

A long time ago we have been thinking about renewing the `burp()` sound of the library, since we want to give it a new look for the next version, so we have decided to create this competition to be able to get amazing burp sounds. 

The jam will take place on Itch.io, users can upload a project which has a downloadable audio file with a burp sound of themselves, a friend, a family member, or even your pet!

From **10/17/22** to **10/17/22**, yes, only one day!!!
