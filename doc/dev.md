# Developing Kaboom

To start developing Kaboom, first clone the github repo

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/replit/kaboom
```

Run the `install` command to install the dev packages

```sh
$ npm run install
```

Then run the `dev` command to start the dev server

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

This will start a server that serves the kaboom website, and build the source files on file change.

Also remember to run `check` to check for typescript errors and linting.

```sh
$ npm run check
```
