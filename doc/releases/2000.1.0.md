# 2000.1.0

## Record mode

Press F6 (in debug mode) to start recording a video! And press again to download.

Or use `record()` to manually record.

## Text Transformations

We've added a way to unlock the possibilities of stylizing text: the `transform` option on `text()` component and `drawText()`

```js
add([
	text("Oh hi", {
		transform: (idx, ch) => ({
			color:
		}),
	}),
])
```

## Opaque Events

Some kaboom components triggers events that you can listen to, like

```js
// from body()
player.on("ground", () => {
	player.stun(1)
})

// from sprite()
player.on("animEnd", () => {
	destroy(player)
})
```

But the truth is you probably never heard about them, because they're no where on the documentation! Now we expose all events as functions like

```js
// from body()
player.onGround(() => {
	player.stun(1)
})

// from sprite()
player.onAnimEnd("hit", () => {
	destroy(player)
})
```

So you'll get proper documentation like all other functions, and type / jsdoc support.

## Toward Better API Consistency

Function names should effectly imply what they do and how they work. So far we're not doing well on this and a lot of the function names are causing confusion. It's time to pay the debt and start making improvements.

Here's the current ideal Kaboom naming scheme:

- `loadXXX()` for loading assets. They take a name as the first argument, and return a Promise that resolves when the loading is complete.
- `onXXX()` for registering event listeners. They receive a callback function as the last argument that gets called when the specific events get triggered, and return a function to cancel the event listener.
- `drawXXX()` for drawing. They'll take a single table argument containing all the drawing property.
- `testXXX()` for collision detection between 2 shapes.
- `addXXX()` for adding stuff. They wrap `add()` with some existing configuration of components and return the added game object(s).
- `setXXX()` for setting state.
- `getXXX()` for getting state.
- `isXXX()` for getting boolean state.

In this release, we cleaned up the event register functions and added versions with `on` prefix as the preferred style, e.g.

- `onKeyPress()`
- `onCollide()`
- `onClick()`
- `onGround()`
- `onUpdate()`

There's also the long confusion between words `action` and `update`. They're exactly the same thing in kaboom, but sometimes we use one and sometimes we use the other (e.g. in component definition you use `update` to define per-frame action, but `action` to define the same thing on a game object). We think it's too confusing to keep 2 names around, and decided to encourage people to only use the word `update`.

```js
// Register an event that runs every frame
player.onUpdate(() => {
	debug.log("hi from every frame")
})
```

Another benefit of making all event registers to start with `on` is: You're never supposed to nest an event register inside another one. E.g. You should never do this:

```js
// big nono! registering an event every frame will blow up your computer
obj.action(() => {
	obj.collides("enemy", handleHit)
})
```

But now where every event register function starts with `on`, we can conveniently say: "You should never put a function starts with `on` inside another function starts with `on`." Nice and easy.

The old functions will still work and not affected at all until the next major version release, but it's recommended to embrace the new style!

## Component for State Machine

We added a `state()` component that help you better program behaviors with the finite state machine modal.

For example, here's how you might program a simple enemy AI, rotating between `"idle"`, `"attack"`, and `"move"` 3 states.

```js
const enemy = add([
    pos(80, 100),
    sprite("robot"),
    // use our state() component here
    state("idle", ["idle", "attack", "move"]),
]);

// this will run once when enters "attack" state
enemy.onStateEnter("attack", () => {
    enemy.play("attackAnim", {
        // any additional arguments will be passed into the onStateEnter() callback
        onEnd: () => enemy.enterState("idle", rand(1, 3))
    })
    checkHit(enemy, player)
})

// this will run once when enters "idle" state
enemy.onStateEnter("idle", (time) => {
    enemy.play("attackAnim", {})
    wait(1, () => {
        enemy.enterState("move")
    })
})

// this will run every frame when current state is "move"
enemy.onStateUpdate("move", () => {
    enemy.follow(player);
    if (enemy.pos.dist(player.pos) < 16) {
        enemy.enterState("attack")
    }
})
```
