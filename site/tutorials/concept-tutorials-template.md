# Heading 

Introduce Kaboom and write a brief description of what the tutorial covers. 

_Next, describe how to create a new project in Replit, including a suggestion for a possible file name. Further, explain that there is boilerplate code that is pre-loaded when a new Kaboom project is created. The text below is an example._

## Creating a new project in Replit

Head over to [Replit](https://replit.com) and create a new repl. Choose **Kaboom** as your project type. Give this repl a name, like "AddSprite".

After the repl has booted up, you should see a `main.js` file under the "Code" section. You'll see some code already written for you to add a sprite. To learn more about this code, take a look at `add-sprite-tutorial.md`.

## Explain the code

This explanation can take many different formats. Ideally, it's worth breaking up the code in relevant sections and explaining each section of code to make it easier for the reader to understand and absorb the information.

You're welcome to include extra headings as you see fit.

## Things to try

At the end, point the reader to https://kaboomjs.com/ where they could learn more about the Kaboom library. Also, include a couple of challenges that the reader could try to extend the code and build their knowledge/skills.
